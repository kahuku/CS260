            <h2>My Current Research Topics at BYU's CSRL</h2>
            <h3>GANs for Password List Generation</h3>
            <p>The former director of the CSRL, Justin Giboney, published a paper
                on using information gathered by OSINT (open source intelligence) 
                to generate passwords lists that would be potential current 
                passwords the study participants may be using. I propose to further this
                research by using a <strong>G</strong>enerative <strong>A</strong>versarial
                <strong>N</strong>etwork to generate potential passwords for hash cracking
                with higher accuracy.
            </p>
            <h3>Gamification for Enhancing Undergraduate Cybersecurity Education</h3>
            <p>My team and I at the CSRL wrote a research proposal on the effects
                of gamification in undergraduate cybersecurity education--specificaly, how 
                the use of <strong>Capture the Flag (CTF)</strong> competitions can be used to 
                foster positive emotional responses during the difficult stages of the 
                learning process. 
            </p>
            <p>We submitted our proposal to the <em>Organized Cybersecurity Journal</em>
                in November. We are still waiting to be assigned an editor, but in the time
                since the paper has been sent out for review, the BYU CSA club hosted
                an end-of-semester CTF, from which we were able to collect survey responses
                to begin anaylzing to determine a trend between experience in cybersecurity
                and positive vs negative emotions felt, and hopefully we will be able to prove
                that gamified learning encourages participation from less experienced students.

            <h2>Former Research Topics at the Air Force Research Lab</h2>
            <h3>Object Detection</h3>
            <p>At the Air Force Research Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, I was on a team
                researching state of the art object detection algorithms to enable
                UAVs to preform better in-flight target diagnostics.
